> Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not;
> nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not;
> unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of
> educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The
