## Introduction
Features like drag and drop are one of the many user interfaces that have come
to be expected in modern web applications. HTML5 defines an event-based
mechanism and JavaScript API that allows us to make just about any element on a
page be draggable. Combine that with the power of Ember and we can easily
create reusable draggable components for our web applications.
